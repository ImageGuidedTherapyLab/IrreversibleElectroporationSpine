IRE Spine Project
----------------------

Code, notes, and writeup 

 * publications are projects stored in a self contained git repo that contain code as well as write-up

Standard prefixes for commit messages
-------------------------------------

following - http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Git/Develop

 *  BUG: Fix for runtime crash or incorrect result
 *  COMP: Compiler error or warning fix
 *  DOC: Documentation change
 *  ENH: New functionality
 *  PERF: Performance improvement
 *  STYLE: No logic impact (indentation, comments)
 *  WIP: Work In Progress not ready for merge 


Naming Conventions
------------------

following - `http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Coding_Style_Guide#Naming_Conventions`

 * Names are constructed by using case change to indicate separate words, as in TimeStamp (versus Time Stamp).
 * Underscores are not used.
 * Variable names are chosen carefully with the intention to convey the meaning behind the code.
 * Names are generally spelled out
 * Use of abbreviations is discouraged. (Abbreviation are allowable when in common use, and should be in uppercase as in RGB.) While this does result in long names, it self-documents the code.
 * If you learn how to use name completion in your editor (e.g.,Vim, Emacs), this inconvenience can be minimized. 

Submodule Organization
----------------------

http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#Starting-with-Submodules

 * proposals and pdf presentations stored as single git repo organized by funding source
   * submodules are used to point to publications within funding source

    git submodule add git@github.com:ImageGuidedTherapyLab/IrreversibleElectroporationSpine.git publications/IrreversibleElectroporationSpine
    git commit -am 'DOC: ire paper'

Submodule Usage

http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#Cloning-a-Project-with-Submodules

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

refresh all remotes' branches, adding new ones and deleting removed ones.
----------

    git remote update --prune

remove large file from history
----------
https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/

 * run from top of repo and push changes

    git filter-branch --force --index-filter  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/largefiles/*' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
    git push origin --force --all

 * other forks/branchnes need to rebase to the master... dangerous ?  (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

    git pull --rebase origin master


extract a subdirectory as a new repo
----------
https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/

 * git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter YOUR_FOLDER_NAME master
 * git push my-new-repo -f .


Merging Repos
----------

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13040958/merge-two-git-repositories-without-breaking-file-history

Here's a way that doesn't rewrite any history, so all commit IDs will remain valid. The end-result is that the second repo's files will end up in a subdirectory.

1. Add the second repo as a remote:

   cd firstgitrepo/
   git remote add -f secondrepo username@servername:andsoon

2. Create a local branch from the second repo's branch:

   git branch branchfromsecondrepo secondrepo/master; git checkout branchfromsecondrepo

3. Move all its files into a subdirectory:

   mkdir subdir/
   git ls-tree -z --name-only HEAD | xargs -0 -I {} git mv {} subdir/

4.  Merge the second branch into the first repo's master branch:

   git commit -m "STYLE: organizing files"; git checkout master; git merge branchfromsecondrepo

5. clean up

   git branch -D branchfromsecondrepo; git remote rm secondrepo

6. git log --follow file

   Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file).
